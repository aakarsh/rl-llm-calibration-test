\begin{abstract}
The popularity of large language models has lead to a growing 
need to characterize their behavior and understanding 
beyond the generation grammatical sentences. In this study we 
attempt to replicate and extend the calibration study of 
\cite{kadavath2022language} on open models and datasets, 
attempting compare model reported response probabilities to 
their actual calibration, that is the certainty with which a model answers 
a question with a given completion and the probability that the 
model is answering the question correctly. 
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

%% Introduction, motivation and explanation of the research question in the context 
%% of the field / the class, explaining why it is intersting / novel in comparison 
%% to extant related work. Note that it is NOT mandatory to include an 
%% exhaustive literature review; it is sufficient to mention relevant work 
%% from the project proposals and the class materials

\section{Method}

\subsection{Introduction}

We measure the calibration in keeping with the methodology presented 
in  \cite{kadavath2022language}. The model is queried in either a
0-shot or 5-shot manner. The transformer model is given a question 
prompt  with the each of the multiple choice options.  In the 5-shot 
methodology, in addition to the question under test we proceed the 
question with 4 additional questions with in the same multiple 
choice format in order to provide the model with enough context to 
understand the expected format for answering the question.

For each prompt completion pair we compute the log probability of 
the completion normalized by its completion length. 




\subsection{Dataset}

The Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) 
\cite{hendrycks2021measuring} is a massive dataset of multiple choice 
questions which covers 57 tasks in various subjects including 
elementary mathematics, US history, computer science, law, and more. It 
serves as a challenging dataset for most modern large language models and can be used to evaluate their calibration.

\subsection{Model Calibration}

We compare the calibration of the Llama \cite{touvron2023llama} model 
7b-chat and 13b chat models for answering multiple choice questions in 
figure ... 

We note that that the calibration of the model while not perfect improves 
with the size of the model with the 13b-chat model being better calibrated 
and closer to the ideal calibration line than the 7b-chat model. Thus we 
note that models sizes improves not only the performance of the model but
the calibration of the model as well.
